Title: Pac-Man-Perimeter-Tracing

Description: Watch Pac-Man as he follows the perimeter of the page. Pac-Man was rotated so that he is always in the correct orientation.

How to Run: In order to see Pac-Man trace the perimeter of your screen, download Pac-Man.js, PacMan1.png, PacMan2.png, PacMan3.png, PacMan4.png, PacMan5.png, PacMan6.png, PacMan7.png, PacMan8.png, and index.html into the same directory. Open index.html in your preferred browser and watch Pac-Man go!

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, it would be fun to try to create dots for Pac-Man to follow, and fruit for Pac-Man to eat as traces the perimeter.
